PRD: Document-to-Notion Knowledge Base Nanoservice Workflow

Introduction

This document outlines the Product Requirements for a Nanoservice Workflow that automates saving a text document into a Notion knowledge base. The workflow will accept a plain text or Markdown document (submitted by a user or an AI assistant) and ensure it is categorized before creating a corresponding page in Notion. If a category is not provided in the input, the workflow will interactively prompt the user (via Claude Desktop using the Model Context Protocol) to select or create a category. The result is a complete Notion page with an auto-generated title, the specified category, and the document content. This PRD defines the workflow architecture, node definitions, data flows, and integration details required to implement this feature.

Goals and Objectives
	•	Seamless Knowledge Capture: Automatically send user or AI-generated documents to a Notion knowledge base with minimal friction.
	•	Mandatory Categorization: Ensure every document is tagged with a category for organization. If no category is given, prompt the user to choose or create one.
	•	Interactive Workflow: Leverage Claude Desktop’s MCP integration to ask the user for additional input (category) in a conversational manner when needed ￼.
	•	Accurate Notion Integration: Create a new Notion page in the designated database with the document’s content, a clear title (auto-generated), and metadata (category, timestamps, etc.).
	•	Secure Authentication: Handle Notion API authentication either via a secure integration token or OAuth, ensuring user permissions and data safety.

Workflow Architecture Overview

Trigger: The workflow is invoked when a user or AI provides a text document (e.g., through an MCP command or an HTTP trigger). The input payload contains the document content (plain text or Markdown), and possibly a category embedded in the text (e.g., a line like “Category: XYZ”). The workflow proceeds through the following high-level steps:
	1.	Category Check (If-Else Node): An initial conditional node checks if the input document includes a category label. This is implemented with a Nanoservice If-Else node that evaluates the input for a category indicator (e.g., a regex match for a “Category:” prefix or a dedicated field in the payload).
	•	If Category Present: Extract the category value and proceed to page creation steps.
	•	If Category Missing: Trigger a branch that will retrieve existing categories and prompt the user for categorization (detailed below).
	2.	User Prompt for Category (Missing Category Branch):
	•	Fetch Existing Categories (API Call Node): The workflow calls the Notion API to retrieve the list of current categories. This can be done either by querying a “Categories” database or by retrieving the schema of the target knowledge base database to get the defined options for the Category field. The Notion API provides an options array for select/multi-select properties ￼, which the Nanoservice will parse to get available category names.
	•	Interactive Prompt via MCP: Using the Model Context Protocol integration, the workflow (as an MCP tool) prompts the user through Claude Desktop to choose a category. The assistant will present the list of existing categories to the user (e.g., “Please choose a category for this document from the list, or type a new category name: [Cat A, Cat B, Cat C]”). This is facilitated by MCP’s two-way connection between the AI assistant and the external workflow ￼ – effectively, the workflow supplies a response that Claude presents to the user, then waits for the user’s reply.
	•	User Category Selection: The user either selects one of the provided categories or specifies a new category name. The user’s response is passed back into the workflow (via MCP) to continue the branch. If using a single-run workflow model, the Nanoservice might complete at this point and rely on a second invocation with the chosen category; however, with Claude Desktop’s interactive MCP context, the workflow can be designed to pause and resume when the user responds (if supported by the Nanoservice runtime).
	3.	Category Creation (if New Category): If the user entered a new category that wasn’t in the existing list, the workflow will:
	•	Check for duplicates in a case-insensitive manner to avoid creating a category that only differs by case or spacing. (If a duplicate is found, the workflow can choose to use the existing category instead of creating a new one, or inform the user that the category exists.)
	•	If truly new, create the category in Notion. Depending on the Notion knowledge base design, this might mean:
	•	Select/Multi-Select Property: Simply include the new category name when creating the page. Notion’s API now supports dynamic creation of new select options by specifying the new name in the page creation request ￼ ￼. The workflow will leverage this feature to add the category on the fly, if the Category property is of type select or multi_select.
	•	Separate Category Database (relation): If categories are a separate database and the knowledge base page has a relation to that database, the workflow will use a Notion API call to create a new page in the Category database for the new category (after verifying it doesn’t exist), and then use that relation ID in the document page.
	•	This step is performed via an API Call node to the Notion API (either a Create Page call to the Category database or an Update Database to add a select option, if needed). The node should construct the request payload and handle the response to confirm the category was created or to capture the new category’s ID for use in the next step.
	4.	Notion Page Construction: Once the category is determined (either the original one provided, an existing one chosen by the user, or a new one created), the workflow creates a Notion page for the document in the target knowledge base. This is done through a Notion API Call node configured to send an HTTP POST request to Notion’s pages endpoint. Key details for this step:
	•	Parent Database: The parent property must be set to the Notion Database ID of the knowledge base (as parent: { "database_id": <KnowledgeBaseDB_ID> }). This ensures the new page is created in the correct database.
	•	Title Auto-Generation: The workflow will generate a title for the Notion page. If the input document is Markdown, the title could be the first top-level heading (# Heading) or the first line of text. If the document has no obvious title line, the workflow can create one (e.g., using the first few words of content or a timestamp). The title will be set in the Notion page properties. For example, in the Notion API a title is a rich text array in a Title property ￼. The workflow might set a property "Name" (if the database’s title property is named “Name”) with the title text.
	•	Category Property: The Category field is set in the page properties. If it’s a select or multi-select, the workflow includes the category by name or ID in the properties. (Using name is convenient, as Notion can match or create the option. For instance, including "Category": { "multi_select": [ {"name": "NewCategory"} ] } in the properties will tag the page with that category, creating it if necessary ￼.) If the category is a relation, the workflow provides the relation field with the category page’s ID.
	•	Content Blocks: The document content is added to the Notion page. Because Notion’s API requires page content to be added as blocks, the Nanoservice must convert the input text/Markdown into an array of block objects. For simplicity, an initial implementation might put the entire text into one Paragraph block or as Markdown-converted blocks (headings, lists, etc., corresponding to Notion block types). This conversion can be handled within a custom node or prior to the API call. (Note: If Markdown is complex, consider using an existing Markdown-to-Notion converter or keeping the formatting minimal.)
	•	Metadata: The workflow can attach any additional metadata available as properties – for example, an “Author” property (set to the user’s name or “AI” if the source is AI), or a timestamp property for created time (though Notion automatically tracks created_time). These are optional but should be included if the Notion database schema has such fields.
	•	Notion API Response: The Notion API will return a JSON response for the page creation request, including the new page’s id and other details. The workflow should capture this response, e.g., to confirm success or to extract the URL of the new page. (Notion’s URLs can be constructed from the ID or directly taken if provided.)
	5.	Confirmation to User: After successfully creating the page, the workflow will send a confirmation message back to the user (via Claude Desktop). This can be done in the workflow by a Mapper/Response node that formats a friendly message, such as: “✅ Your document has been saved to Notion in Category: X. (Title: Y)”. If possible, include a direct link to the Notion page in the response. The link can be the Notion URL (which typically is https://www.notion.so/<PageID> or a more readable URL if the page title and workspace are public). This confirmation lets the user know the process is complete and provides quick access to the content.

Node Definitions and Workflow Syntax

The workflow will be defined in the standard Nanoservice JSON/YAML structure. Below is an outline of the key nodes and their configuration, using accurate Nanoservice syntax and examples:
	•	If-Else Node – Category Check: This is the first node in the steps array of the workflow. It uses the Nanoservice if-else module to branch logic based on a condition. For example:

"steps": [
  { "name": "check-category", "node": "@nanoservice-ts/if-else", "type": "module" }
],
"nodes": {
  "check-category": {
    "conditions": [
      {
        "type": "if",
        "condition": "ctx.request.body.content.match(/^Category:\\s*\\w+/i) != null",
        "steps": [
          { "name": "parse-category", "node": "category-parser", "type": "module" },
          { "name": "create-page", "node": "notion-create-page", "type": "module" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "else",
        "steps": [
          { "name": "fetch-categories", "node": "notion-list-categories", "type": "module" },
          { "name": "prompt-category", "node": "user-prompt", "type": "module" },
          { "name": "handle-response", "node": "category-selection-handler", "type": "module" },
          { "name": "create-page", "node": "notion-create-page", "type": "module" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
}

In this pseudo-structure:
	•	The condition uses a regex to check if the content contains a “Category:” prefix (this is one way to embed category in text). If the condition is true (category exists), it executes the parse-category and then create-page steps (happy path). If false, the else branch executes steps to fetch categories, prompt the user, handle the user’s category selection, and finally create the page after obtaining a category. This structure mirrors the typical if/else pattern in Nanoservice workflows ￼ ￼.

	•	Category Parser Node: (Used in the if-branch when category is present in input.) This node would extract the category from the text and clean the document content. It could be a simple Mapper/Function node that uses a small script: find the line starting with “Category:” and set ctx.vars.category to that value, and remove that line from ctx.vars.content (to ensure the content sent to Notion doesn’t include the category header). The inputs/outputs for this node might look like:

"parse-category": {
  "inputs": {
    "content": "${ctx.request.body.content}"
  },
  "function": "({inputs, vars}) => {\n  const text = inputs.content;\n  const match = text.match(/^Category:\\s*(.+)$/mi);\n  if(match){ vars.category = match[1].trim(); }\n  vars.cleanedContent = text.replace(/^Category:.*$/mi, '').trim();\n  return {}; \n}"
}

(The actual implementation might differ; this illustrates capturing the category into ctx.vars.category and the cleaned content into ctx.vars.cleanedContent for later use.)

	•	Notion List-Categories Node: This is an API Call node responsible for retrieving existing categories from Notion. This could be implemented via an HTTP GET request to Notion’s API. Two possible approaches:
	1.	If categories are a select property in the main database: Use the “Retrieve Database” endpoint (GET /v1/databases/<db_id>) to get the database schema, then parse the properties.Category.select.options list from the response ￼. The node would output a list of category names (and IDs/colors if needed).
	2.	If categories are a separate database of their own: Use the “Query Database” endpoint (POST /v1/databases/<categories_db_id>/query) with no filter to retrieve all category pages, then extract their names.
The Nanoservice node would be configured with necessary inputs like the Notion API URL, authentication header, and any query parameters or body. For example:

"fetch-categories": {
  "inputs": {
    "url": "https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/<KnowledgeBaseDB_ID>",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${env.NOTION_TOKEN}",
      "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"
    }
  }
}

After execution, ctx.response.data for this node will contain the JSON from Notion. The workflow can then extract the category list: e.g., ctx.response.data.properties.Category.select.options array (if using approach 1). This list will be passed to the next node. (If needed, a small Mapper node could format the list into a simple array of names for easy display to the user.)

	•	User-Prompt Node: This node represents the action of prompting the user via Claude Desktop. In practice, this may not be a distinct node type but rather the workflow returning a response that the AI relays to the user. However, for clarity we describe it as a node that takes the categories list and produces a prompt. For instance, a Mapper node could take the list of categories from fetch-categories and output a prompt string like: “No category was provided. Available categories: A, B, C. Please reply with one of these or a new category name.” Claude (through MCP) will present this message to the user in the chat interface. This leverages the Model Context Protocol’s ability to allow the AI assistant to ask follow-up questions and gather additional context ￼.
Note: The Nanoservice platform should support waiting for user input at this stage. If it doesn’t support long-lived waiting, an alternative is splitting the workflow: the initial run ends after outputting the question, and a subsequent run (triggered by the user’s reply as a new input) continues the process. For this PRD, we assume MCP allows the tool to pause until a response is received.
	•	Category-Selection Handler Node: This node processes the user’s response from the prompt. If the user picks an existing category name from the list, the handler simply captures that choice (e.g., set ctx.vars.category to it). If the user provides a new category name, this node will flag that a new category needs to be created (e.g., ctx.vars.category = <newName> and ctx.vars.isNewCategory = true). The logic may also normalize the category string (trim whitespace, possibly capitalize consistently) and check against the fetched list to double-ensure it’s new. If it finds a duplicate (perhaps the user typed “Sales” and there’s “sales”), it can decide to use the existing one or alert the user of duplication. For simplicity, the workflow can treat names case-insensitively and consider them duplicates if any match ignoring case.
	•	Notion Create-Page Node: This is the critical API Call node that creates the Notion page for the document. It must gather all required inputs before execution: the final category (and if new, ensure it’s created or will be created on page insert), the page title, and the page content. The node will perform an HTTP POST to https://api.notion.com/v1/pages. Key aspects of the request payload (JSON):
	•	parent: {"database_id": "<KnowledgeBaseDB_ID>"} (the knowledge base database ID, likely stored in a configuration or environment variable).
	•	properties: an object containing at least the Title and Category (and any other metadata fields). For example:

"properties": {
  "Title": {
    "title": [{
      "text": {"content": "<AutoGeneratedTitle>"}
    }]
  },
  "Category": {
    "select": { "name": "<CategoryName>" }
  }
}

In the above, if <CategoryName> doesn’t exist yet as an option and the Category property is a select, Notion will create it dynamically ￼ ￼. If Category is multi-select, the syntax would use "multi_select": [ {"name": "..."} ]. (If using a relation for category, the properties would include the relation property with an array of page references instead.)
We cite a simplified example for a Title and other properties in a Notion create page call ￼ ￼ – the actual payload will conform to the target database’s schema.

	•	children: an array of block objects representing the document content. For example, if the content is plain text without special formatting, it can be one paragraph block:

"children": [
  {
    "object": "block",
    "type": "paragraph",
    "paragraph": {
      "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "<Document content...>" } }]
    }
  }
]

If the content was Markdown and parsed, multiple blocks (headings, lists, etc.) would be included accordingly.
The Nanoservice should ideally use a template or a small script to assemble this JSON. The inputs to this node would include dynamic fields such as the title, category, and content (likely referencing ctx.vars that were set in earlier nodes). For example:

"create-page": {
  "inputs": {
    "url": "https://api.notion.com/v1/pages",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${env.NOTION_TOKEN}",
      "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "body": {
      "parent": { "database_id": "${env.KB_DATABASE_ID}" },
      "properties": {
        "Title": {
          "title": [ { "text": { "content": "${ctx.vars.title}" } } ]
        },
        "Category": {
          "select": { "name": "${ctx.vars.category}" }
        }
        // ... other properties if needed
      },
      "children": "${ctx.vars.notionContentBlocks}"
    }
  }
}

Here, ${ctx.vars.title} is the auto-generated title (set by a prior function node), ${ctx.vars.category} is the final category name, and ${ctx.vars.notionContentBlocks} is a context variable containing the prepared Notion block array of the content. (If assembling the JSON within a pure JSON config is difficult, a custom function or mapper could construct the body as well.)
After this node executes, ctx.response.data will contain Notion’s response data for the new page. A successful creation typically yields a JSON with the page object including an id. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid auth or payload), the response will contain an error code and message. The workflow should handle both outcomes appropriately.

	•	Response/Confirmation Node: Finally, a Mapper node (or simply using the output of create-page node if it can return directly) will generate a user-facing confirmation. This node might take the page ID or URL from create-page response and format a message. If the workspace is accessible via URL, the URL can be constructed as https://www.notion.so/<PageID> (Notion page IDs are UUIDs; if the integration returns a short URL or if the workspace has custom domain, that could be considered). If constructing the URL is not straightforward, the confirmation can omit it and just say it was saved. Example output message:
“Document saved to Notion under Category: Knowledge ✅. Title: Guide to Nanoservice Design. You can find it in your Knowledge Base.”
This message will be relayed to the user by Claude, concluding the workflow.

Throughout the JSON workflow definition, we will use clear naming for nodes (check-category, fetch-categories, create-page, etc.) and minimal inline code, delegating logic to small function nodes where necessary. This improves readability and maintainability. (For instance, rather than writing a very long condition or string manipulation in the If-Else condition, we used a separate category-parser node.)

Data Flow and Context Passing

Each node in the Nanoservice passes data via the context (ctx) object, which includes the request, response, and variable storage:
	•	Input Context: The trigger provides ctx.request (for an HTTP trigger, ctx.request.body contains the input JSON; for an MCP invocation, a similar structure will be present). The document text is available here (e.g., ctx.request.body.content). The workflow may also accept a ctx.request.body.category field if the user or AI explicitly provided a separate category field (though our primary scenario expects the category inside the content or missing).
	•	If-Else Node Context: The If-Else node does not itself consume or produce data beyond routing. It evaluates ctx (which at this point holds the input) against the condition. If the condition is true, it executes the inner steps; if false, the else steps. The important design here is that the context (ctx) persists through the branches. For example, after the Category Check, in either branch, the original ctx.request is still accessible to subsequent nodes.
	•	Category Parser Output: The category parser (if used) will typically set ctx.vars.category and ctx.vars.cleanedContent. The use of ctx.vars is a way to store intermediate data in Nanoservice workflows (persisting across nodes for the life of the workflow). In the branch where category was present, after this node, the workflow should use ctx.vars.cleanedContent for content (so that the “Category: …” line is removed) and ctx.vars.category for the category going forward.
	•	Fetch-Categories Output: When the Notion list-categories node calls the API, the results (list of categories or the database schema) will be in ctx.response.data of that node. Typically, in Nanoservice, each node’s output can be accessed by subsequent nodes. For example, if fetch-categories returns data, the next node user-prompt could reference it. If the output is complex, we might insert a small transformation: e.g., a Mapper node could take ctx.response.data (the raw Notion response) and produce a simpler list, stored in ctx.vars.categoryList. This would make it easier to insert into the prompt message.
	•	User Prompt and Response Handling: The prompt node outputs a message (likely as ctx.response.body or similar) that is sent to the user via Claude. At this point, the workflow waits. When the user responds, the input to the category-selection handler will be that response. If the workflow continues in the same execution (streaming mode), the MCP integration would feed the user’s answer into the ctx.request of the next step. If instead the workflow is split, the second invocation’s ctx.request will contain the user’s answer and possibly a reference to the previous context (MCP might maintain a state or the assistant could supply the previous context ID). In any case, the handler node needs to read the user’s provided category name from input. For example, ctx.request.body.content might carry the reply text if triggered via the conversation. The handler then sets ctx.vars.category accordingly and a flag if new.
	•	Category Creation (if needed): If a new category needs to be created via Notion, an API call node (similar to fetch-categories, but a POST to create a category entry or to update the database schema) will run. Its output would confirm the new category’s existence (e.g., a new page in Category DB or success status). After this, we ensure ctx.vars.category is set to the final category identifier needed for the page creation (this might still be the name if using select, or it could be an ID if using relations).
	•	Create-Page Inputs and Output: The create-page node will pull from context variables to build its request. As shown, we use env for static config (Notion token, DB IDs) and ctx.vars for dynamic content (title, category, blocks). On success, ctx.response.data from this node contains the created page object (including id). We may capture the page URL here if needed (Notion API doesn’t directly give a URL, but the ID can be used). We could set ctx.vars.pageUrl by concatenation or simply communicate the success.
	•	Final Response to User: The final mapper node uses values like ctx.vars.category and ctx.vars.title (and optionally ctx.vars.pageUrl) to format the confirmation message. This message is then delivered back through the same channel (Claude Desktop chat). Since this is the end of the workflow, ctx.response.body (or equivalent) will contain the final output message content for the user. If using HTTP triggers, that would be the HTTP response; in MCP context, it’s the assistant’s reply to the user.

By clearly defining the data passed between nodes (in ctx.vars or directly via ctx.response.data references), we ensure each component has the information it needs. The examples above (using ${ctx.vars...} in node inputs) illustrate how one node’s output feeds into another’s input in a Nanoservice definition ￼ (e.g., using the prior step’s response in the next step’s query or body).

Authentication and Security

Because this workflow interacts with the Notion API, proper authentication and user authorization are crucial:
	•	Notion API Credentials: We must decide between an integration token or OAuth for user-specific access. For an MVP or single-tenant scenario, a fixed Notion Integration Token (provided by a Notion internal integration) can be used. This token would be stored securely (e.g., as an environment variable NOTION_TOKEN on the Nanoservice platform) and included in the Authorization header for all Notion API calls. This token grants the workflow permission to the pages/databases it was invited to in the user’s Notion workspace.
	•	User-Specific OAuth: In a multi-user scenario (e.g., if this Nanoservice is part of a product where each user connects their own Notion), implementing OAuth 2.0 with Notion is necessary. In that case, the workflow would need access to the user’s access token. This might involve an initial setup where the user authenticates via Notion and the token is stored (perhaps associated with their Claude Desktop or MCP profile). The PRD assumes a simpler approach (integration token), but it must be clarified:
	•	If multi-user: The system will use OAuth 2.0 – the user is directed to log in to Notion and authorize the integration, which returns a token. The token is then used by the Nanoservice for that user’s requests. Token refresh logic must be handled (Notion’s tokens may expire if using OAuth; the Nanoservice should be able to refresh them or prompt re-auth when needed).
	•	If single shared token: Ensure the token has access only to the intended database(s). The knowledge base database and (if separate) categories database must be shared with the integration user. This token method is straightforward but all documents go to the same Notion workspace.
	•	Security Measures: Regardless of auth method, we must handle credentials carefully:
	•	Do not log sensitive info (like the Notion token or full content of documents if not necessary).
	•	Use HTTPS for all API calls (the Notion API endpoints are HTTPS by default).
	•	In MCP, ensure that any sensitive data in context (like token) is not exposed to the user. The token stays server-side in env variables. The MCP communication between Claude and the Nanoservice should be secure (MCP is designed for secure integration ￼).
	•	If using OAuth, store refresh tokens encrypted and only transmit them over secure channels. Possibly utilize the Nanoservice platform’s built-in secrets management.
	•	Permissions: The Notion integration (whether token or OAuth) must have insert/read access to the relevant databases. For a token, that means the integration is added to the Notion pages/databases with appropriate permissions. For OAuth, the scope requested should include databases.read, databases.write, pages.write (and possibly pages.read if we need to query or confirm content), and if a separate category database is used, access to that as well.
	•	User Identity and Multi-user: If multiple users can use this workflow, we may need to map each user to their Notion credentials. That is outside the core workflow logic, but the design could include a lookup (e.g., env.NOTION_TOKEN_USER_${userId} or similar) if implementing multi-user. At minimum, clarify that this PRD’s scope is one Notion workspace (unless extended for multiple via OAuth).

Error Handling and Edge Cases

Robust error handling ensures a good user experience and data integrity:
	•	Missing Category Input (User Error): If the user fails to provide a category initially, the workflow’s design is to prompt them. We should also handle if, after prompting, we still cannot get a valid category. For example, if the user’s answer is empty or not understood, the category-selection handler can detect that and possibly reprompt: “Sorry, I didn’t catch that category. Please type the category name or ‘new: ’ to create a new one.” This prevents proceeding without a category. In worst-case (user refuses to provide one), the workflow can abort and inform the user that the operation was canceled due to no category.
	•	No Categories Existing: If the knowledge base is brand new and no categories exist yet, the fetch-categories step might return an empty list. The prompt to the user should handle this gracefully, e.g.: “No categories exist yet. Please enter a name to create the first category for this document.” (And the workflow will then create that category.)
	•	Duplicate Category Names: The logic will check for duplicates when creating a new category. However, if two users simultaneously create the same new category in parallel runs, there is a small race condition – both might attempt to add it. Notion’s behavior for select properties in such a case would be to create one option first; the second call might then see that name exists (if the API doesn’t auto-merge by name, it could create a duplicate option with the same name, which is possible since Notion identifies options by an internal ID). To mitigate this:
	•	We could perform a final check by retrieving categories again after attempting to create (to see if it already was added).
	•	Or catch a Notion API error if any (though since Notion now allows dynamic creation without error ￼, we won’t get a failure on duplicate names).
	•	As a best practice, perhaps use a consistent casing for category names and document in user guidelines that names must be unique.
	•	Notion API Errors: The Notion API may fail for various reasons: invalid JSON payload, unauthorized token, network issues, rate limiting, etc.
	•	The Notion API Call nodes should check the HTTP response status. If a call returns an error (non-200 status), the workflow should handle it. For example, if the create-page node fails, the workflow can go to an Error node that formats an error message to the user: “❗ Failed to save document to Notion: [error reason]. Please try again or check your credentials.” Using a pattern similar to the error node in Nanoservice (like how method-not-allowed was handled in the example workflow) can produce an HTTP 4xx/5xx response or message ￼.
	•	For known failure modes, provide specific messages:
	•	401 Unauthorized -> “Notion authentication failed. Please ensure your integration token is valid or re-authenticate.”
	•	404 Not Found -> If using user-specific DB IDs, perhaps the database ID is wrong or not shared. “Target Notion database not found or inaccessible.”
	•	Validation error -> “Could not create page: data format issue (e.g., a property name might be incorrect in configuration).” This might require developer intervention to fix the workflow, but at least log it.
	•	Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts or 429 rate limit). Maybe a simple retry once after a short delay for network issues. Notion’s rate limits are fairly generous, but the workflow should catch 429 and either retry or inform the user to try later.
	•	Content Size Limits: Notion has limits on block payload sizes and overall request size (~1MB per request for the API). If the document is extremely large, the create-page call might fail or truncate. The PRD should note that for very large documents, we might need to split content into multiple pages or at least multiple block chunks via the append blocks endpoint. However, as an initial approach, we assume typical use (documents of a few thousand words at most). If needed, include an error message for content too large: the workflow could check content length and warn the user if it exceeds a threshold.
	•	Markdown Edge Cases: If the document contains complex Markdown (tables, embedded images, etc.), our conversion might not support those fully in Notion (since Notion API has specific block types for some, and some like tables require a structure). This is an implementation detail; the PRD can state that initially we handle basic formatting (paragraphs, headings, lists, code blocks, quotes). This isn’t exactly an “error”, but a limitation to document. The user should be informed that advanced formatting might not fully carry over. In future iterations, we can extend the parser for more Markdown features.
	•	Claude/MCP Interaction Errors: Since we rely on MCP for prompting, handle cases where the user does not respond within a reasonable time or closes the prompt. Possibly set a timeout for waiting on category input. If timed out, either try again or abort with a polite message. Also, ensure that if the conversation context is lost, the workflow can still proceed logically or at least not hang indefinitely. The MCP is designed for robust AI-tool interactions, so this is likely handled by the host (Claude Desktop) in terms of keeping context. Still, the workflow should account for a scenario where user input is not provided (maybe by eventually exiting with an error message after X minutes of inactivity).
	•	Logging and Monitoring: All interactions with external APIs (Notion) and key decision points (like branch taken, category chosen/created) should be logged at an appropriate level. This aids debugging if something goes wrong. For example, log the category the user provided, log if we create a new category or use existing, log Notion API responses (or at least status codes). Since this is a backend service, these logs would not go to the user, but to the developer console or file. This is a best practice to include in requirements for maintainability.

Best Practices and Implementation Notes

To ensure the Nanoservice workflow is clear and maintainable, we will follow these best practices in design:
	•	Clear Node Naming and Descriptions: Each node will have a descriptive name (and we can include a description field in the workflow JSON if supported to explain its purpose). For example, check-category for the conditional, notion-create-page for the final API call, etc. This makes the workflow self-documenting to a degree.
	•	Modularity and Reusability: Where possible, logic should be encapsulated in re-usable nodes or functions. For instance, if parsing the category or generating the title is complex, those can be separate function nodes that could be reused in other workflows. The if-else structure cleanly separates the two paths (with and without category), making it easier to modify one path without affecting the other. Also, if in the future we want to reuse “notion-create-page” node for other workflows, we can parameterize it (taking database ID and content as inputs).
	•	Accurate Syntax for Nanoservice Definitions: The workflow JSON must follow the Nanoservice framework’s schema. The example snippet we provided aligns with the pattern: top-level steps list, and a nodes object with configurations. Types of nodes ("type": "module" for built-in or custom modules, etc.) must be correct. Using the official if-else module (@nanoservice-ts/if-else) ensures we follow known syntax ￼. Similarly, if using an HTTP request node, use the standard module or specify the function appropriately. All string interpolations (e.g., ${ctx.vars.category}) and JavaScript snippets (if any, marked by js/ or in a function field) must be tested for correctness.
	•	Testing Scenarios: Define test cases for the workflow:
	•	Document with category provided (should go straight to Notion, no prompt).
	•	Document without category (should prompt and then continue).
	•	New category vs existing category in the prompt response.
	•	Error case (simulate Notion API fail or invalid token).
	•	Very long content (if possible, test near limits).
This will validate that each branch and error handler works as expected.
	•	Performance Considerations: The workflow involves multiple sequential API calls (retrieve categories, possibly create category, then create page). Each call adds latency. While this is acceptable (each call maybe ~100-300ms, total under a couple seconds typically), users might notice the delay especially with the extra prompt step. To mitigate any frustration:
	•	The prompt to user should appear quickly. The fetch-categories call is the only thing before the prompt; ensure it’s optimized (Notion DB schema retrieval is usually fast). Possibly we could present the prompt immediately with a generic message and fetch categories in parallel – but to give accurate options, we likely need the data first. For now, sequential is fine.
	•	After user responds, creating page is quick. We can perhaps show a typing indicator or a short “Saving to Notion…” message through Claude (the assistant can indicate it is working) until confirmation appears.
	•	If performance becomes an issue, consider caching categories (so we don’t hit Notion every time for the list, unless there’s a change). Since categories don’t change often, we could cache the list in memory or a local store for X minutes. This is an optimization not required in the first version but noted for future improvements.
	•	Compliance and Data Handling: Ensure that by storing user documents in Notion, we have the user’s consent and this aligns with any data policies (especially if the user is using Claude Desktop in a corporate environment). The PRD should note: the content is being sent to an external system (Notion). This is generally expected since the user specifically wants to save to their Notion, but it’s good to clarify assumptions: e.g., the Notion integration is set up by the user so they are aware of where data goes.
	•	User Experience: The flow of conversation through Claude should be smooth:
	•	If no category: AI: “It looks like you didn’t specify a category for this document. Let’s organize it. Here are the existing categories: [List]. You can pick one or create a new category by typing the name.”
	•	User responds.
	•	AI: “Great, saving your document under Category: X…” (perhaps as it calls create-page).
	•	AI: “✅ All set! I’ve saved it to Notion with the title "Y" in category "X".”
This conversational style should be implemented in how the prompt and confirmation nodes format their messages. The PRD encourages using emoji or checkmarks for success, and clear wording, to align with best UX practices in chat.
	•	Example and References: During development, developers can refer to existing Nanoservice workflow examples (like the db-manager.json example) to ensure correct JSON structure ￼ ￼ and to copy patterns like error handling with an "error" node if needed. Also refer to Notion API documentation for correct payload formats (e.g., how to format rich text and select options) ￼ ￼. We have incorporated these into the design to reduce trial-and-error.

By adhering to these best practices, the resulting workflow will be robust, clear, and easy to update. All team members (developers, testers, etc.) should be able to read this PRD and the corresponding workflow definition and understand how the system is supposed to behave.

Conclusion

This Product Requirements Document specifies a Nanoservice workflow that connects user-provided documents to a Notion knowledge base with required categorization. The workflow uses an If-Else branching logic to handle presence or absence of a category in the input, interactive prompts via MCP to get missing info from the user, and Notion API calls to create or update content in the knowledge base. The design emphasizes clarity (both in user interaction and in workflow configuration), proper error handling, and security in managing Notion authentication.

By implementing this workflow, users will be able to easily file away notes or AI-generated content into their Notion workspace, with the system guiding them to categorize the information for future retrieval. This fosters organized knowledge management without leaving the context of their chat or AI assistant environment. The next steps would include prototyping the nodes (especially the Notion integration ones), testing the end-to-end flow with Claude Desktop, and iterating on the user prompts for optimal experience. With the requirements detailed above, the development team should have a clear blueprint to build and deploy this feature.
